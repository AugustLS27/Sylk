# Sylk
 
A tentative API agnostic renderer with support for OpenGL 4.6, Vulkan 1.3 and DirectX 12, targeted at Windows and Linux.
This renderer is mostly intended to be a learning experience to better grasp how graphics concepts are implemented in different APIs.
However, the intent is for it to be complete enough to support simple 2D and 3D game development.
Sylk should be as easy as possible to use, without compromising on flexibility.

Dependencies currently include GLFW and Glad, though I'm sure more are to come (such as glm).
